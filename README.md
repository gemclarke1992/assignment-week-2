# assignment-week-2

I have been asked to create an image gallery that has accessibility features such as being able to be seen on a desktop and a mobile phone. i will need to make sure to add buttons that can switch between images and be able to show that i understand the skills set needed to be able to make this gallery work as i intend to.

i started writing up my css using the grid method but then i was told it may be easier for me to use the flex method instead.

i have also got to challenge myself to use the Dom method. i have struggled with this so far but i am determined to make it all work for me to make writing up my bulk of my work easier.

i really struggled with this assignment as i felt as though i was writing words without knowing how to read.

but i ended up using MDN to make it so much easier to understand even if it was completely different to how we were taught in class.

i ended up using the DOMs to be able to create a gallery with a thumbnail bar that the user can click through the images to see them through the display screen.

i did attempt to use the grid method but i didnt enjoy it and i couldnt have used it for the assignment breif.

i did end up using chat gpt to fix the main issue i had and it just ended up being that i mismatched a couple of things so im really happy i was able to write everything out myself and it was an easy fix to get my gallery working.

i would have liked to have added left and right buttons to make the galllery more interactive.
